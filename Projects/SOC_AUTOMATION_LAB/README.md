## This is the day 1 that i am working on this project
first we have to draw a diagram to map out how we want to build our lab 
I use draw.io to create a diagram to understand it logically and visually. This will help you to better know how the things that done by you is related to your home lab.

We use Wazuh Manager which is the central server component of the Wazuh security platform, responsible for managing and analyzing security data from Wazuh agents deployed on various systems. It collects, analyzes, and stores data from agents, and triggers alerts when security events match defined rules

Shuffle Automation SOAR(Security Orchestartion Automation Response) is a free open-source automation tool that helps us to build this SOC automation lab and enrich the alerts that have been passing through it.

It Goes as follows:-

üõ°Ô∏è SOC Automation Setup
This project illustrates a Security Operations Center (SOC) automation workflow designed to streamline event monitoring, alerting, enrichment, and automated response actions.

üìå Project Overview
The SOC automation setup integrates various components to detect, analyze, and respond to security events in real-time. It includes a flow that starts from event generation on endpoints and moves through event collection, analysis, enrichment of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), alerting, and automated response execution.

üîÑ Workflow Description
Send Events: Endpoints (workstations/servers) generate security events and forward them to the SIEM system.

Receive Events: SIEM collects and stores incoming events from all sources.

Send Alerts: Based on predefined rules, SIEM generates alerts for suspicious events.

Enrich IOCs: The alert data is sent to a threat intelligence platform for IOC enrichment.

Send Alerts: Enriched IOCs and contextual alerts are pushed to an orchestration tool.

Send Email: Notifications are sent to SOC analysts via email.

Send and Receive Email: Analysts receive alerts and can take actions via email or dashboard.

Send Response Action: Automated response actions are sent back from the orchestration tool to the relevant endpoint.

Perform Response Action: The endpoint executes the response (e.g., isolate host, kill process, block IP).

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

Threat Intelligence Platform

Email Server

Endpoints/Workstations

‚úÖ Use Case
This setup is ideal for:

Real-time threat detection and response

Reducing mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR)

Enhancing SOC efficiency through automation
